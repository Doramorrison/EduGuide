            <p >ESL stands for (English as a Second Language) and refers to non-native speakers of English in countries where English might be less common. It means people who learn English as a secondary language to their own.
 
                Students all over the world study English as a Second Language, from Japan to Spain. Teachers from English-speaking countries such as the UK, the USA and Australia often travel abroad to teach English. Countries such as Vietnam, Spain, China, South Korea, Japan, and the UAE are popular locations for ESL teachers.</p><br>
                <p class="" style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">Which one is harder?</p>
                <p>EFL is for students who speak English fluently and want to develop advanced reading, writing, and critical thinking skills. The exams focus on analyzing texts, summarizing, and writing creatively or persuasively, which requires a strong vocabulary and understanding of complex grammar.</p>
                <p>ESL is designed for students who are still learning English as a second language and focuses on practical skills like listening, speaking, reading, and writing. The assessments are simpler, with tasks like writing emails or understanding basic texts.</p><br>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Overall,</span> EFL is harder than ESL because it focuses on advanced English skills, while ESL is for students who are still building their basic English.                                                    </p>

            <p>For university courses like Social Sciences, Humanities, or Arts, Mathematics E is enough.</p><br>
            <p style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">Which One is Harder?</p>
            <p>You can choose Mathematics (E) if you're not planning to use study subjects that requires advance math in the future.</p>
            <p>Mathematics (A) if you're planning to study subjects that requires advance math, complex math solving skills in the future.This option will better prepared you for university and show that you're capable of handling very hard math questions.</p>
